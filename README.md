# ProjectAurora (Intro to Comp Sci Final Project)

## I would like to give credit to w3schools for guidence with the HMTL and CSS portion of my code and ChatGPT for assisting me in writing the Javascript portion of my code as well.

## I created this game as a simple project to allow the user to get a feel for how fast their reflexes are under a certain time period. I also gave them a retry button so that they can go for as many times as they like without reaching for the refresh button.
